Earth Lab Dockerfiles
=====================

This is a repository for Dockerfiles that provide out of the box functionality for Earth Lab projects.
All of these Dockerfiles provide the source code for images hosted at https://hub.docker.com/u/earthlab/.

## But I want a different image!

In Earth Lab, but don't see what you're looking for?
Open an issue and we'll build it for you!
